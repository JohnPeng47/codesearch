In the `AgenticLoop`, the `search_result` is utilized within the `handle_action` method of the `SearchCode` class. When handling a `Search` action, the method performs a search using the `CodeIndex.search` function with provided search parameters. The results from this search, stored in `search_result`, are then processed to create a list of `RankedFileSpan` objects. These objects contain details about the file paths and relevant code spans found during the search. If no relevant spans are found, the method retries the search with adjusted parameters. Otherwise, the method transitions to the next state in the loop, incorporating the `ranked_spans` and search parameters into the action response output.
